This scripts helped me buy a GPU when the market was in short supply.


### OndeGPU.py
The purpose of this script is to only check the availability of GPUs in various stores.\
You can adapt the list of the products for your needs.

The script automatically alerts the availability of the products using a Telegram bot.

### PCDIGA_AutoBuyer.py
The purpose of this script is to automatically buy products from PCDiga.\
You need to adapt the the custom variables to your needs, namely your account info and the product that you want to buy.

The script needs to use the MBWay payment method in order to be fully automated. After the purchase you only need to confirm the payment in your MBWay app.
